	<p>Hi there,<br>
		Sometimes you just want to send a simple HTML email with a simple design and<br>
		clear call to action. This is it.
	</p>
		<button style="background-color: #3598dc;, padding: 10px; text-decoration: none;">Call To Action</button>
	<p>
		This is a really simple email template. Its sole purpose is to get the recipient to click<br>the button with no distractions.
	</p>
	<p>
		Good luck! Hope it works.
	</p>
